            "Excellent question! The code will always remain free, but maintaining servers, database and infrastructure costs money. Your contribution helps us keep the tool free for everyone. It's a win-win model: you get premium features, the community keeps free access!",

          question: "Can I self-host Workout.cool?",

            "Absolutely! The entire codebase is available on GitHub under MIT license. You can deploy it on your own servers, customize it however you want, and use it completely free. Self-hosting gives you full control over your data and workout privacy.",

          question: "Are my workout data secure?",

          question: "Can I cancel my subscription anytime?",
          answer:
            "Of course! No contracts, no commitments. Cancel with one click anytime. You'll keep access until your current billing period ends, and you can always restart later. Your workout data remains accessible even if you downgrade to free.",

          question: "Are there exercises for beginners?",

          question: "Can I import data from other apps?",

        q2: "Should I eat exactly this many calories every day?",
        a2: "These are average daily targets. It's normal to eat slightly more some days and less on others. Focus on your weekly average rather than being exact every single day. Listen to your body's hunger and fullness cues.",
        q3: "What if I'm not seeing results after following these recommendations?",
        a3: "If you're not seeing results after 2-3 weeks, you may need to adjust. Your actual metabolism might be higher or lower than calculated. Try adjusting by 100-200 calories and monitor for another 2 weeks. Also ensure you're tracking your food accurately.",
        q4: "Are the macro recommendations suitable for everyone?",
        a4: "The 30/40/30 split (protein/carbs/fat) is a balanced approach suitable for most people. However, athletes, people with medical conditions, or those following specific diets (keto, vegan, etc.) may need different ratios. Consult a nutritionist for personalized recommendations.",
